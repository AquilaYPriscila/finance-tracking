Personal Finance Tracking Program

This program allow user to input income amount for different categories (Employment, investments, and others) as well as expense amount for several categories (Rent, utilities, food, and others). Then the program will call a sum of income and expense. Moreover, the program asks userâ€™s saving percentage goal. After calculating the actual saving amount, the program will show the actual saving percentage that the user saved. In the end, it will open a text file which display income, expense, and saving amount.

The "simple_calculation_GUI" helps the user to quickly estimate the total monthly savings. This program was edited and revised by myself from a program created by Mr. Bernd Klein. Please check his code of the orginal program here: https://python-course.eu/tkinter/entry-widgets-in-tkinter.php
